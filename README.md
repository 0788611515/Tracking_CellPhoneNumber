From country name, Network /Service and location

### Architecture
```sh
If you do download all the file just start yarn install
  Then use all the pip install
  But if you want to follow line by line all you need is to create a folder and have to file on it
   ##1. main.py
    install all dependancied mention on #pip install
    you will have to run it 3 times
    A. on line 20 print(locations) 
     just to make sure that you do not have any error to identify the correct country
    B. on line print(carrier.name_for_number(service_pro, "en")) 
         just to make sure that you do not have any error to identify the correct network/service
    C. on line print(lng, lat) 
         just to make sure that you do not have any error to identify the exact location 

```

```sh
   ##2. myphone.py
   on this file you just need onbe line of code
   numer = "type the numbee with country code"

```
